The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).



## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Add compatibility for JSR experiment type
- Add codemeta file

### Changed
- Directly use the Markdown formatting of the README on pypi, rather than converting to reST
- Remove unnecessary `orcid` package from the test environment
- Specify versions of all package dependencies
- Use pip to install package in conda build
- Composition type is included in the pandas data-frame resulting from `to_dataframe()`

### Fixed

## [0.4.1] - 2018-03-09
### Added
- Documentation for old versions is available on the Releases page of the docs

### Changed

### Fixed
- Doctr deploys on tags now
- Syntax changes for example files in the documentation

## [0.4.0] - 2018-03-07
### Added
- New method to instantiate a `ChemKED` class directly from a ReSpecTh XML file
- The `__version__` attribute can be imported from the top-level module
- New `time-histories` field to replace the `volume-history`. This field allows specification of several other relevant parameters besides volume.
- Added `rcm-data` field and moved `compressed-temperature`, `compressed-pressure`, and `compression-time` to this field
- Added `stroke`, `clearance`, and `compression-ratio` to the `rcm-data` field
- Added conda-forge instructions to the installation documentation
- Allow alpha versions to be specified during testing

### Changed
- Crossref lookups via Habanero now comply with the "be-nice" policy
- Removed `UnboundLocalError` from error processing for reference validation
- Switch to flake8 for style checking in CI services
- `file-author` field is now a list called `file-authors`
- ReSpecTh->ChemKED converter function now returns a dictionary, while the command-line entry points write out files
- Require Habanero>=0.6.0 to support the `mailto` argument
- Require pytest>=3.2.0 to support the `pytest.mark.filterwarnings` decorator
- Deprecate the `volume-history` field in the ChemKED YAML file and replace with `time-histories`
- ORCID lookups are now done by a function in the local `orcid.py` module, removing an external dependency
- Composition in a `DataPoint` is now stored in a dictionary of `namedtuple`s (called `Composition`) rather than a list of dictionaries

### Fixed
- Crossref lookups in the converters use the common API instance from validation
- `d/dt max extrapolated` ignition type can be converted to/from ReSpecTh
- Tests now check for appropriate warnings and ignore unrelated warnings

## [0.3.0] - 2017-10-09
### Added
- New extrapolated ignition type, where the maximum slope is extrapolated to the baseline
- Tests that the composition type is stored properly in the `DataPoint`
- `species_conversion` dictionary can be passed to the `get_cantera_mole_fraction` and `get_cantera_mass_fraction` functions to change the name of a species in the output string
- Jupyter Notebook examples of usage

### Removed
- Removes `elemental-composition` as a synonym for `atomic-composition`

### Fixed
- Fixes `test_incorrect_doi_period_at_end` docstring

### Changed
- Conda builds are now noarch - one package for all Pythons!
- pip installs now require Python compatible with 3.5
- Appveyor runs a single job and no longer builds conda packages
- Remove journal from required fields in the reference

## [0.2.1] - 2017-08-31
### Fixed
- Fixes Cantera convenience output functions

## [0.2.0] - 2017-08-10
### Added
- Adds ChemKED method to write new file, with tests
- Adds converters to and from ReSpecTh files, with tests
- Adds command-line entry points for converter scripts
- Add docs for converters

### Fixed
- `ignition_type` dictionary in `DataPoint` is now `deepcopy`d

## [0.1.6] - 2017-07-17
### Added
- Added logo files to repo
- Added `first_stage_ignition_delay`, `compressed_pressure`, and `compressed_temperature` as properties

### Changed
- Added Zenodo collection DOI to CITATION.md

## [0.1.5] - 2017-05-22
### Added
- Schema can now be split into multiple files via `!include` directive

### Fixed
- Remove Python 2.7 classifier from `setup.py`
- DataFrame output for datapoints lists with multiple compositions (i.e., a species not in all compositions)

### Changed
- Improved tests with no internet
- Improved tests with no warning

## [0.1.4] - 2017-04-21
### Added
- Add `skip_validation` keyword argument to the `ChemKED` initializer

### Removed
- Python 2.7 support is removed again

## [0.1.3] - 2017-04-13
